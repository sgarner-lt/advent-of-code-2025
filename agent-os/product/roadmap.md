## Success Criteria

**Technical Completion:**
- All 10 days solved successfully in all 5 languages (50 total solutions)
- All solutions validated for correctness and cross-language consistency
- Performance benchmarks collected for all implementations
- All code tested with both sample and real puzzle inputs

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Functional proficiency in Rust, Roc, Gleam, Carbon, and Bosque
- Deep understanding of paradigm differences and when to use each language
- Ability to write idiomatic code (not just translated solutions)
- Portfolio demonstrating multi-language expertise

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive comparison notes for each challenge
- Performance analysis across all 5 languages
- Lessons learned and best practices documented
- Retrospectives completed after project completion

> **Important Notes**
> - **Each day is its own phase** because problems release daily at midnight EST (Dec 1-10)
> - You can only `/shape-spec` for days that have been released
> - Each phase represents a complete feature: analyze problem → implement in 5 languages → validate → compare
> - Learning goals for Days 4-10 will be updated as problems are revealed
> - Cross-language validation is required before moving to the next day
> - **Advent of Code 2025 is a special 10-day event**, not the usual 25 days
