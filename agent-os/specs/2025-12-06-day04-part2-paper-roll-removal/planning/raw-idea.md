# Raw Idea: Day 4 Part 2 - Paper Roll Removal Simulation

Feature description: Day 4 Part 2 - Paper Roll Removal Simulation

The problem is about iteratively removing accessible rolls of paper from a warehouse grid. Once a roll is removed, it may expose other rolls that can then be accessed and removed by forklifts. The goal is to calculate the total number of rolls that can be removed through this cascading process.

Key details from the problem:
- Start with a grid of paper rolls (marked with @)
- Forklifts can only access and remove rolls that meet certain accessibility criteria
- After removing a roll, check if new rolls become accessible
- Continue until no more rolls can be removed
- Count the total number of removed rolls

The user has provided the full problem statement which shows an example where 43 rolls can be removed through 8 removal iterations (13, 12, 7, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1).

Create the spec folder with today's date (2025-12-06) and save the raw idea. Then provide me with the spec folder path so we can proceed to requirements gathering.
