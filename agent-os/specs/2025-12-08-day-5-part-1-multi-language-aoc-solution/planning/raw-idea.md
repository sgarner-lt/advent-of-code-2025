# Raw Idea

**Feature Name**: Day 5 Part 1 - Multi-Language AoC Solution

**Description**: Implement Advent of Code 2025 Day 5 Part 1 solution in all 4 languages (Rust, Gleam, Carbon, and Bosque) with cross-language validation. This follows the established pattern from Days 1-4 where we solve the same problem in parallel across all languages and validate that all implementations produce identical correct answers.

**Context**: This is part of Phase 5 of the Advent of Code 2025 project roadmap. The project structure and validation framework are already established from Days 1-4. The Day 5 problem was released on December 5th at midnight EST.
