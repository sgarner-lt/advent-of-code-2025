# Spec Initialization: Day 3 Analysis

**Date:** 2025-12-08

## Initial Description

Compare approaches and document language-specific observations for Day 3 Advent of Code solutions. This involves analyzing implementations across Rust, Gleam, Carbon, and Bosque to understand string processing/pattern matching expressiveness and language-specific strengths.

## Context

- Part of Advent of Code 2025 multi-language learning project
- Day 3 solutions are already complete in all 4 languages
- Phase 3 Learning Goals: Implement string processing or pattern matching, Compare expressiveness across languages
- Task is marked as incomplete in the roadmap (line 54)

## Status

Status: Initialized
Next Step: Requirements research
