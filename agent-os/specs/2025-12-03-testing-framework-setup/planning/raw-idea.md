# Raw Feature Idea: Testing Framework Setup

**Phase:** 0, Item 3
**Date:** 2025-12-03

## Feature Description

Implement cross-language validation system that can run tests in all 5 languages and verify identical answers between implementations

This is Phase 0, Item 3 from the roadmap. The system needs to:
- Run tests across Rust, Roc, Gleam, Carbon, and Bosque
- Validate that all implementations produce identical answers
- Support both sample and real puzzle inputs
- Be used for Advent of Code 2025 challenges
