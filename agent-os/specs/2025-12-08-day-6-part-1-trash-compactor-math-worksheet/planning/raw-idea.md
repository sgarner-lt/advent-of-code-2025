# Raw Idea

## Feature Name
Day 6 Part 1 - Trash Compactor Math Worksheet

## Description
Implement a solution for Advent of Code 2025 Day 6 Part 1 in all 4 languages (Rust, Gleam, Carbon, Bosque). The problem involves:
- Parsing a vertical math worksheet where numbers are arranged in columns
- Each column has an operation (* or +) at the bottom
- Columns are separated by full columns of spaces
- Solving each vertical problem (multiply or add all numbers in the column)
- Computing the grand total by summing all problem answers

## Main Goal
Solve the math worksheet parsing and computation problem across all 4 languages with cross-language validation to ensure identical results.

## Context
This is part of the Advent of Code 2025 multi-language learning project. Each solution should demonstrate idiomatic use of the language while solving the same algorithmic challenge.
