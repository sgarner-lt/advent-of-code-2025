# Spec Initialization: Day 4 Analysis

**Spec Name:** Day 4 Analysis

**Date Created:** 2025-12-06

## Initial Description

Compare approaches and document language-specific observations for Day 4 solutions across all 4 languages (Rust, Gleam, Carbon, Bosque) in the Advent of Code 2025 project.

This is a recurring pattern - previous days (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3) have already been completed and analyzed. This will be the Day 4 version of that analysis.

## Context

This is part of the Advent of Code 2025 project where solutions are being implemented in multiple languages (Rust, Gleam, Carbon, Bosque) to compare language characteristics and approaches.

Previous analysis specs:
- Day 1 Analysis
- 2025-12-05-day-2-analysis
- Day 3 Analysis (likely exists)

This spec will follow the same pattern for Day 4 solutions.
