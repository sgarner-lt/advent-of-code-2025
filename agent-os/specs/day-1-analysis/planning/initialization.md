# Spec Initialization: Day 1 Analysis

## Feature Overview

**Title:** Day 1 Analysis

**Size:** XS

**Roadmap Context:** Phase 1, Item 6

## Original Description

Compare approaches and document language-specific observations.

## Background Context

Day 1 has already been solved in multiple languages with both Part 1 and Part 2 completed:
- Rust
- Gleam
- Carbon
- Bosque

The goal is to analyze and compare these implementations to understand the different approaches taken and document language-specific observations.

## Initial Requirements

This feature focuses on creating analysis and documentation that compares the Day 1 solutions across different programming languages. The analysis should help identify patterns, trade-offs, and unique language features utilized in each implementation.
