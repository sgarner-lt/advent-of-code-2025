# Raw Idea: Advent of Code 2025 Day 7 Part 2

## Feature Description

Implement a quantum tachyon manifold solver where:
- A single tachyon particle is sent through the manifold
- At each splitter, the particle takes BOTH left and right paths (quantum superposition)
- This creates multiple timelines using the many-worlds interpretation
- Need to count the total number of distinct timelines after the particle completes all possible journeys

## Context

This is Part 2 of Day 7 in the Advent of Code 2025 challenge. Part 1 dealt with classical tachyon manifolds. Part 2 introduces quantum mechanics where particles exist in superposition.

## Key Challenge

Calculate how many different timelines would exist after a single tachyon particle completes all possible paths through the manifold diagram.

The problem statement shows examples where 40 different timelines result from various path combinations through the manifold.
