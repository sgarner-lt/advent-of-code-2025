# Raw Idea

**Feature Name:** Day 2 Part 1

**Description:** Implement Part 1 solution in all 4 languages with cross-language validation

**Context:** This is part of an Advent of Code 2025 project where solutions are implemented in Rust, Gleam, Carbon, and Bosque, with validation that all implementations produce identical answers.

**Learning Goals (Phase 2):**
- Practice iteration, conditionals, and collection manipulation patterns
- Build confidence with each language's standard library
