# Advent of Code Problem-Solving Standards

## Problem Analysis

1. **Read Carefully**: Thoroughly read the problem statement, paying attention to:
   - Input format and constraints
   - Edge cases mentioned
   - Sample inputs and expected outputs
   - Part 1 vs Part 2 requirements

2. **Understand the Data**:
   - Identify data structures needed
   - Determine parsing strategy
   - Consider data size and performance implications

3. **Plan Before Coding**:
   - Sketch out the algorithm
   - Identify potential optimizations
   - Consider time/space complexity

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Sample Data**:
   - Always test with provided examples first
   - Add the sample data to test cases
   - Verify output matches expected results

2. **Parse Input Robustly**:
   - Handle different line endings
   - Trim whitespace appropriately
   - Validate input format

3. **Structure Your Code**:
   - Separate parsing from logic
   - Use clear function names
   - Keep functions focused and testable

4. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Test each component independently
   - Validate intermediate results
   - Use assertions for invariants

## Common Patterns

- **Grid Problems**: 2D arrays, coordinate systems, pathfinding
- **Graph Problems**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths, cycles
- **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, bottom-up solutions
- **String Parsing**: Regular expressions, state machines
- **Combinatorics**: Permutations, combinations, backtracking
- **Number Theory**: GCD, LCM, modular arithmetic

## Debugging Tips

1. Print intermediate values
2. Visualize the problem when possible
3. Check boundary conditions
4. Verify loop termination
5. Test with minimal examples
