# Analyze AoC Problem

Analyze an Advent of Code problem and suggest an approach.

## Analysis Steps:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - What is the input format?
   - What is being asked for?
   - What are the constraints?

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Does this fit a known algorithm pattern?
   - Is it a graph, grid, string, or math problem?
   - What data structures would be most appropriate?

3. **Sample Data Analysis**:
   - Work through the sample manually
   - Identify the transformations needed
   - Spot any edge cases

4. **Complexity Estimation**:
   - Estimate input size
   - Consider time/space complexity
   - Flag if optimization may be needed

5. **Approach Recommendation**:
   - Suggest 2-3 possible approaches
   - Rank by simplicity vs efficiency
   - Recommend starting point

6. **Multi-Language Considerations**:
   - Identify which languages are best suited for this problem
   - Note any language-specific advantages or challenges
   - Consider how different paradigms (functional, imperative, etc.) might approach it
