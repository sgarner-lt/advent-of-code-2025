# Bosque Language - Advent of Code 2025

Bosque is a research programming language developed by Microsoft Research. It is in an experimental state with limited tooling and documentation.

## Status

Bosque is an experimental research language and may have:
- Limited or unavailable compiler/interpreter tooling
- Incomplete standard library functionality
- Minimal file I/O capabilities
- Sparse documentation and examples

## Running Solutions

Bosque tooling availability will determine how (or if) these solutions can be executed. Check the official Bosque repository for the latest compiler/interpreter status:
https://github.com/microsoft/BosqueLanguage

## Solution Structure

Each day's solution follows the same pattern:
- `namespace Main;` declaration
- `public function main(): String` entry point
- Helper functions for Part 1 and Part 2
- File paths reference `../../challenges/dayXX/` for input files
